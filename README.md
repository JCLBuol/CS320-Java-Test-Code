How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  The first step is gathering as clear and concise requirements as possible.  Once you have the requirements then getting the development team on the same page as far as who is working on what and how testing and validation will occur.  When writing the code it is imperative that industry standards are used
  to insure that the code is easy to read and understand, maintainable and as easy as possible to debug.  Having code reviews and thorough testing will help find any bugs or functional problems with the code and having input validation can help keep user input more secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  I have found the best way to interpret user needs is to work closly with the users and stakeholders as possible either through interviews, surves or workshops.  By keeping them involved in the development cycle any missunderstandings or requirement changes can be found quickly and incorperated into the 
  project on the fly.  This can help reduce the amount of time that is required to fix something if it is done during development instead of at the end when much more may have to be changed to incorperate the new information.  Also using flow charts and other documents that the stakeholders can view and approve prior   
  to the start of development can help ensure that the requirements are exactally what they want.

How do I approach designing software?

  Starting any project the most important step will be detailed requirement gathering.  Once the requirements are gathered having a meeting with the team and the stakeholders to verify all of the information and clear up any questions that the team may have would be an ideal way to start the development process.
  Conceptualizing the design through flow charts and prototyping can help layout an effective path throught the development process.  Using an iterative development process where the projects is continuously refined based on feedback from stakeholders and users helps to keep the project on the correct path through 
  development.  Testing and validation should be completed throughout the process to make sure that each step along the way functions as it is intended to.  There should also be a continuous improvement loop where based on feedback from tests, stakeholders and users the code is refined and improved on to enhance 
  functionality.
